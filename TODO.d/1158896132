Is it possible to reduce mail copies?  If a message is sent to multiple
      addresses, and those addresses forward to other addresses, each end
      user should get only one copy.  Would require that the transport code
      receive delivery information for all recipients, and delivery to all
      of them, and resolve all forward destinations.
