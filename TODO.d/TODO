Change mydestination so that it doesn't have "$myhostname" in it:
   mydestination = localhost.$mydomain, localhost

If a user forwards a message to themselves, and have local delivery on, the
message will be delivered 49 times and then a bounce sent.

Change install instructions to have users send an install report to us
after the installation is complete, similar to what DJB does.

Precedence in user_rules.php allow 3 digits, limit to 0-99.

Set up spam blocking of messages from domains which remote IP don't match
      domain name.  Examples:
         Return-Path: <anonymous@www2.serverroom.us>
         Received: from www2.serverroom.us (unknown [216.128.72.163])
         From: Bank of America <service@bankofamerica.com>
         --
Address books, including shared/domain/global books.
   Using LDAP I imagine, would have to see what various clients support.
Add web interface for limiting users who can use IMAP.
On domain create, optionally allow creating postmaster and abuse accounts,
      with optional forwarding to another account.  Suggested by Raul A.
      Gallegos.  Per discussion:

      > What about having the "domain create" page have an option for creating
      > these accounts as forward accounts to another address?  Like have a text
      > field where they could enter where to forward to, possibly with a button

      I like that. It sounds like it would work. Also, seems like it would be
      the easiest way to do it now that I think of it.
Make the setup script change the SpamAssassin configuration so that it uses
      "-x" instead of "-c" so that it doesn't read per-user configs.
Allow envelope rules to be specified for both domains and globally.
Update the INSTALL document for vpm-pgmaintain and for setting up
      /usr/lib/vpostmaster/etc/vpostmaster-db.conf
"Apply defaults to all users" button in domain defaults.
"Apply defaults to all users" button in system defaults?
Make the command-line user-add pick up domain defaults.
Create a job that will purge old quarantine messages.
Add "user.php" help documentation and un-comment link from header.php
Show disc space usage reports for a user and for a domain.
      Probably will require a superuser helper.
Have a SpamAssassin action which just tags the subject.
Make spamassassin action which, below a certain level will deliver mail.
   So, an "accept" action, which could be triggered at 0 or -10 or something.
Auto-responder and vacation mail.
Regex matches against headers in the rules code.
Regex matches against the body in the rules code.
Write documentation about backing up the system.
Script to change the various passwords.
Write some architecture documentation about changing Postfix and how
      vpostmaster integrates with Postfix.
Option to strip mime attachments on a folder?
vpmuser connects to the database as root, should use the appropriate auth
      privs.

Check to see if FC system is logging messages like this, and if so have the
RPM create the directory and/or file:
   >Aug 24 10:43:39 kweinert spamd[16037]: info: setuid to vpostmaster
   >succeeded
   >Aug 24 10:43:39 kweinert spamd[16037]: Creating default_prefs
   >[/usr/lib/vpostmaster/.spamassassin/user_prefs]
   >Aug 24 10:43:40 kweinert spamd[16037]: Cannot write to
   >/usr/lib/vpostmaster/.spamassassin/user_prefs: No such file or
   >directory
   >Aug 24 10:43:40 kweinert spamd[16037]: Couldn't create readable
   >default_prefs for [/usr/lib/vpostmaster/.spamassassin/user_prefs]

Switch to a different PySPF:

   QuestionOrComment:
      The wayforward.net version of SPF hasn't been
         maintained.  There are maintained versions
         tracking the official draft RFC standard on
         http://sourceforge.net/projects/pymilter

      The milter package contains a version that is
         API compatible with the wayforward version
         1.6, but tracks the standard.  The permerror
         result is returned as unknown, and temperror
         as error.

      The pyspf package is developed independently
         from the milter package, and is gaining a
         revised API, for instance, no longer
         returning recommended SMTP code, and using
         the RFC result names (permerror and
         temperror).  It aims to be a stand alone
         package for use by all Python email
         software.

      Both packages support the new official type99
         SPF records as well as backward compatible
         TXT records, and parse all mechanisms before
         beginning evaluation so as to return PermErr
         for syntax errors as early as possible.

      We welcome feed back on the pyspf package, and
         hope we can standardize on one Python SPF
         implementation.

Scott: setup debian/ubuntu repositories properly to support pinning.
Scott: get gpg-key verification enabled during install for ubuntu/apt 0.6

Change the name of the fc3 script to fc (so as not to confuse fc4 users)

The headers on the www pages are not consistently aligned with the
'vpostmaster' logo, or the development/new version notice. They should all
be in the same place.

Some errors need to be reported to the site owner. Setup some way of
sending email to that person by clicking a button on the error pages. efm
can create the submit error form, if there is a way to retrieve the site
owner email address.

Make it easier to create aliases for an account when the account is
created.  For example, add a field which takes a comma-separated list of
aliases to create at the same time, and create accounts with those names at
the same time as the main account is created.

Suggestions from Craig Isdahl (used imail)
	Ability to setup an account which receives copies of all messages
	for the domain, like an auto copy, BCC that a normal user can't
	remove.  For archival or managment review purposes.

	Proactive quota notification to the user.  If a user is within
	10 or 20% of quota limit, send them an email so that they can clean
	up before messages start bouncing.

	More integration with Squirrelmail, possibly through squirrelmail
	plugins.  Links between squirrelmail and vpostmaster interfaces
	would be nice, a single sign-on would be even better.

	Improved mailman administration.
