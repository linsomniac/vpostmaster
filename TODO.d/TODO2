Make it so that a notification message can be triggered on mail delivery.
So, user gets an incoming message, and an abstract is forwarded to their
cell phone or similar.  Or an e-mail address which large attachments are
sent to, and a notification is sent to a group that they have a new
attachment sitting there.

For the catch-all address, perhaps in the UI flag the account when you're
in the account view as it being the catch all.  Might be tricky if the
catch-all goes to a forward that is removed.  Perhaps don't allow removal
of a catch-all account, or force it to disable catch-all.

When viewing an account that another account forwards to, mark it in some
way?  When deleting that account, delete the forward?

SASL auth:
   From http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?p=251591#post251591:
   Went back to my original config (the one I had from
   http://high5.net/postfixadmin/ howto) but tried the pam-mysql way of
   doing smtp auth instead of the described sasl2 way, and after some
   debugging...it worked!
