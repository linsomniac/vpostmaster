LICENSE

   vPostMaster is free for non-commercial use in non-commercial
   environments, and 30-day trials.  Please see the vPostMaster web site
   for purchasing and other information.  A "LICENSE" file is included
   with details of the license.

INTRODUCTION

   vPostMaster is a full-featured, easy to install and maintain system for
   handling virtual mail domains with Postfix.  It provides an extremely
   comprehensive set of features including Webmail, POP, IMAP, SMTP,
   SMTP AUTH, SSL versions of the above, virtual e-mail domains, spam
   and virus filtering, user-controlled mail rules, SPF, Greylisting,
   SpamAssassin, ClamAV, White/Black lists, and more.

   Users are able to control their own spam, filter, and mailbox settings,
   on an individual basis.  In other words, you don't have to disable
   greylisting for your entire domain just because a single user wants
   it disabled.

   Domains and users are set up in such a way that system user accounts
   are not required for mail access, preventing mail users from gaining
   access to the system.

   A web-based control panel is installed which allows superusers to
   create new domains and users, domain admins to manage users, and
   users to manage their own spam and mail system settings.  In this
   way, a vPostMaster administrator may delegate management of users
   and domains to third parties.
