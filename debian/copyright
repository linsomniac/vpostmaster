  its utilization under this License), USER must include a text file
  with the source code provided to COMPANY titled "LEGAL" which
  describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient
  detail that COMPANY will know whom to contact. If USER obtains
  such knowledge after USER makes the Modification available to

  USER makes available thereafter and shall notify COMPANY that new
  knowledge has been obtained.

  for the Source Code, where USER describes recipients' rights
  relating to Covered Code. If USER created one or more
  Modification(s), USER may add name as a Contributor to the notice
  described in Exhibit A. If it is not possible to put such notice in

  include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory
  file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.

  CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO USER OR
