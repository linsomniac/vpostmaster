   envelopeRule:

      remoteName

      expireAfter

Policy filter would look at incoming messages and check them against
envelopRule and reject or accept.  It would also check the quota for the
user and accept or reject incoming messages based on that.  SPF and
greylist checking would happen here, though a second SPF lookup may happen
during delivery.

transport file would have "domain pfvirtual:", master.cf would have:
pfvirtual line to send the message off to the virtual delivery agent.
