If multiple spamassassin thresholds were set to the same value, the
      lexigraphically smallest one was selected.  So if both "quarantine"
      and "disabled" were set to the same threshold, disabled would be
      selected.  Now disabled ones are completely ignored, and if multiple
      thresholds are the same, the one appearing earlier in the web
      interface is used.  Reported by JW.
