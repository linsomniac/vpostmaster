Adjusted SPF Temperror handling.  Will now return DEFER_IF_PERMIT if checked
      at smtp time, which only happens when user has reject set.
      Returns DUNNO if checked during delivery (normally when a user has
      Quarantine set, but may also happen if DNS check fails during SMTP
      but succeeds during delivery stage. (Reported by Nataraj)
