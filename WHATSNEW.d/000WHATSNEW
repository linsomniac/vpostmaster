Version 1.24 -- Mon Feb 13, 2006

More documentation from Evelyn Mitchell for the web interface.
Fixing the handling of extension addresses.
Adding vim folding codes to some parts of the code where it was missing.
Pass system meta-data to the message processing code.
Updating schema to version 7.
Importing psycopg into vpmsupp for use in exception handling.
      Fixes a traceback during greylist handling.  Reported by MTWAfrica.
Added X-Original-To: and Delivered-To: headers.

================================
Version 1.22 -- Mon Dec 19, 2005

Splitting out the version string from code.php into version.php.
Fixing a permissions problem with the wwwdb.conf file.  The default setting
      was causing problems with the vpm-wwwhelper generating a warning on
      the creation of a new user:
         Error while calling useradd helper: [...] IOError: [Errno 13]
         Permission denied: '/usr/lib/vpostmaster/etc/wwwdb.conf'
         NOTE: Helper errors leave user in partially added state. You will
         need to delete and re-create the user after resolving the problem.
Making list views more pretty with colorized odd rows.

================================
Version 1.20 -- Fri Dec 09, 2005

Control script updates for Debian and Ubuntu.
No changes for Fedora, just rolling to have the same version for RPM and
      Debian systems.

================================
Version 1.18 -- Wed Dec 07, 2005

Nataraj pointed out that if enabled, greylisting in transport is
      quarantining under some unexpected circumstances.  I've changed it to
      only quarantine in transport when the greylisting action is
      quarantine.
Removing the wwwdb.conf from the package and putting the conf-dist file in
      /usr/share/doc
Quarantined messages are no longer forwarded to users in the forward list.
      Local delivery is done to the quarantine folder, whether "local
      delivery" is set or not, but forwarding is ignored.
Added popup help documentation to the Settings pages. Questions, comments
      and more examples appreciated. Send to efm-vpostmaster@tummy.com.

Brian Cairns reported a NotImplemented exception was logged for his system.
      That should only be reported when a ClamAV action that is
      unrecognised is seen, and may indicate a bad value in the database.
      I changed the exception to a ValueError with information about the
      action that was requested, to make debugging easier.
Added a link to the mailing list on vpostmaster web interface menu.
Scott Kleihege found a problem with wwwhelper when running from vpmuser.
      It now reads the connect information from wwwdb.conf.
RPM spec file now will run vpm-dbupgrade on upgrades.
RPM spec file now restarts postfix on an upgrade.
The RPM spec file was reverting the main.cf mail_name back to Postfix on
   any subsequent upgrade.  Fixed.
Removing the wwwdb.conf file from RPM packaging.  If your file goes
      missing, you will need to run:
         mv /usr/lib/vpostmaster/etc/wwwdb.conf.rpmsave \
            /usr/lib/vpostmaster/etc/wwwdb.conf
      to repair it.
Update check now displays a different message when a development version is
      being used.
adminuser_view was validating name differently than adminuser_create.  An
      admin user with digits in their name couldn't be updated because of
      this.

================================
Version 1.16 -- Thu Nov 03, 2005

Found a bug in the resolveUser() function where it wouldn't properly
      resolve a local user to the destination account.
Spam subject prefix was getting added to non-spam messages.  (Reported by
      Aron Shtull Trauring)
Debugging information added to Greylisting checker.  (Patch contributed by
      Nataraj)
Greylisting would, for all remote message, update the greylist database
      entry twice, once during SMTP and once during delivery.  Nataraj
      contriuted a patch which only does the update if a previous update
      has not been done recently.  This will reduce database activity for
      heavily active users.
Web interface now shows the current version next to "Control Panel".
      (Suggested by Ted Clark)
Nataraj found a bug where postfix would, in the policy, pass a null sender,
      but in the transport would have changed it to
      "mailer-daemon@<domain>".  This caused greylisting to get confused
      and quarantine messages that had made it past greylisting.
Fixing a corrupted image.
If a ".procmailrc" file exists in a user home directory, procmail will be
      called to deliver the message for local folder delivery.  Note that
      you will need to explicitly set the DEFAULT variable in your
      procmailrc for delivery.
vpmuser is now using a connect string instead of the running user's
      privileges.
Moving vpm-pgmaintain into the "bin" directory from the "postfix"
      directory.
The schema now changes table ownership to "vpostmaster".
The vpostmaster password was not getting saved in the setup script.
Web UI: Fields entered as "0" were sometimes treated as blank.  Fixed.
vpm-pfpolicy now traps and logs it's exceptions, since postfix does not.
Allow SpamAssassin to re-write the headers of the message.
Allow users to select if spam status headers should be added to the
      message during delivery.
Allow users to specify a subject prefix if the message is believed to be
      spam.
Greylisting did not work when set to quarantine.  Fixed.  Found by
      code-review.
Changing the form validation in PHP to make better error descriptions in
      cases where the field is empty but required and for character limits.
SpamAssassin action can now include "accept" to unconditionally accept a
      message.
Allow SpamAssassin threshold to go down as low as -30.
Adding accessibility changes to help visually-impaired users.  Suggested by
      Raul A. Gallegos, largely implemented by Evelyn Mitchell.
Multiple simultaneous deiveries to the same box may result in a database
      concurrency error in the greylist table.  Trap and ignore this error.

================================
Version 1.15 -- Wed Oct 12, 2005

Fixing a problem where users with quotas set cannot update their account
      settings and password because it exceeds their quota.  Reported by
      Raul A. Gallegos.
Changing the order of rule checks to: Envelope Rules, SPF, Greylist,
      ClamAV, SpamAssassin.
Changes to the web UI so that it is more obvious when an account is set up
      such that it discards all incoming e-mail.
Fixing a bug where the previous user selected still shows after creating a
      new domain.
Some loop optimizations for checking envelope rules.
Added regex envelope rules.  Prefix a rule with "regex:" to make it a
      regex, and "normal:" or no prefix to make it a normal string comparison.
All envelope rules which do not start with "regex" are now converted
      to lower-case in the web management interface.
Added a set of defaults for new systems.
Forward-only accounts in web interface were showing forward+local.
If incoming messages are *ONLY* being forwarded to a single other local
      vpostmaster address, internal "redirection" will happen instead of
      external forwarding.  This means that the destination accounts
      rules constrain the delivery.
Display the number of active users per domain, suggested by Joel Hoornbeek.
If checkers return anything but success, log it with DEBUG status.
Optional debugging of rules.  Currently, you have to modify vpmsupp.py
      so the "self.debug = debug" line reads "self.debug = 2" (or 1 for
      less debugging).
Fixing the regex for detecting locally generated messages.
      Reported by Ken Weinert.
Adding clamav to requirements in the spec file.
Converting the addresses to lower-case in vpm-pftransport.
      Fix supplied by Nataraj.
Added a status message about quarantining messages, suggested by Nataraj.
Fix for quick double insertions into the greylist database.
      Problem reported by Nataraj.
Modified the checkers to result in "DUNNO" if some of their required values
      are not set.  Problem reported by Nataraj.
Adding "permit_mynetworks" to recipient restrictions.
      Reported by Ken Weinert.

================================
Version 1.14 -- Tue Jun 28, 2005

Resolving a bug where some SPF checks on domains which had no SPF record
      would reject all incomging mail from that domain.
Added debian startup script to replace saslauthd required symlink in
      /var/run that was removed by a different debian startup script.

================================
Version 1.13 -- Mon Jun 20, 2005

Fixing a bug in checking the return-code from SPF, which sometimes wouldn't
      detect SPF telling it to abort.  Reported by Scott Kleihege
Changed the spec file so pre and post scripts always succeed.
Built Debian Unstable and Ubuntu Hoary Hedgehog packages.
Fixing setup-fc3 script so that it does the right config change for
      PostgreSQL version 8 and above.

================================
Version 1.12 -- Sun May 16, 2005

Adding instructions for the SquirrelMail configuration.
The RPM now configures squirrelmail correctly.  Reported by Joel Hoornbeek.
Removing the unused checkboxes in the user lookup, and showing
      account forwarding information.  Reported by Joel Hoornbeek.
User list now also shows account type (forward only, forward+local, local).
Fixing a spec problem with FC2 not pulling the right dovecot release.

================================
Version 1.11 -- Sun May 01, 2005

Forward field can now include multiple addresses.
Changed the way local lookups are done for greylisting to quarantine.
Greylisting and SPF is now disabled for messages from 127.0.0.1 or
      messages locally forwarded.  Forwarded messages should be checked
      on the incoming account that forwards, not the destination account.

================================
Version 1.09 -- Fri Apr 29, 2005

A bug in the local delivery caused 1.08 to fail on delivery.
Changed the post-install script to ignore the failure of the grep.

================================
Version 1.08 -- Wed Apr 27, 2005

Trap exception when SPF fails.  Reported by Roger May.

================================
Version 1.07 -- Fri Apr 22, 2005

Changing install process to set mail_name to vPostMaster
Adding instructions for FC2.
Removed the "Conflicts: postfix" from the spec file, relying on
      postfix+pgsql to conflict.
Adding the line "vpm-pftransport_destination_recipient_limit = 1" to
      main.cf in the install scripts and instructions.  This fixes a bug
      where multiple recipients in the same domain were causing a bounce.
      Reported by Eric Swanson

================================
Version 1.06 -- Thu Mar 17, 2005

Improperly quoting the Forward To field caused SQL Errors on user create
      where Forward To was set.
Validation problem with Forward To field (reported by Tom Rhymes).
Setting system defaults was not properly clearing out the previous data.

      Tom Rymes.

================================
Version 1.04 -- Fri Mar 04, 2005

Fixing a problem in the INSTALL and setup-fc3 scripts which prevented SMTP
   AUTH from being set up properly.  Please see the post to the mailing list
   (http://lists.tummy.com/mailman/listinfo/vpostmaster) for more information
   on fixing it.

================================
Version 1.03 -- Sun Feb 20, 2005

Includes code to look up greylist-incompatible hosts which send non-spam
      messages.
Man page for "vpmuser".
Added the beginnings of a database conversion script for use when doing
      updates.

================================
Version 1.02 -- Sun Feb 13, 2005

Adding a command-line tool for adding and removing users, "vpmuser".
Checkers in the transport are now called for both local and remote messages.
      Should reduce confusion, it confused me.
Changed the schema for Dovecot so that disabled users or users in disabled
      domains cannot login.
Fixed the INSTALL instructions based on review and changes to the SQL for
      detecting deactivated users and domains.
Making the wwwhelper chown the directories that are created if they are
      created as root.  Command-line tool may be run as root.
Changed the user_create quota form field.
