Detect clamdscan availability and use it if clamd is running.  (Suggested by
      CyberLeo Kitsana)
Now you can specify the clamscan command to use in the meta table
      "clamscancommand" row.  The default is "clamscan --stdout -".  It
      needs to be a command that reads the message from stdin and writes
      the clamav output to stdout.  In particular, it uses the presence of
      a line with "FOUND" in it to indicate that a virus was found.
