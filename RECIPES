Recipes for vPostMaster

Aliases for vPostMaster domains:

   vPostMaster does not internally support "aliases".  By aliases, I'm
   talking about a simple mapping of one e-mail address to one or more
   others.  vPostMaster does support having one account forward mail to
   others, optionally while storing a copy in the local account, but this
   does require that a real account be set up, complete with password, etc.

   This is the preferred way of doing aliases in vPostMaster, because then
   all accounts are treated the same, and users don't get confused with two
   separate locations for where an e-mail address may be handled.

   However, you can configure Postfix to do aliases if you absolutely must
   have them.

   In the "main.cf" file, you will need to add the line:

      virtual_alias_maps = regexp:/etc/postfix/virtual-regexp $alias_maps

   And then in the section under "smtpd_recipient_restrictions" you need to
   add the following line before the "check_policy_service
   unix:private/vpm-pfpolicy" line:

      check_recipient_maps regexp:/etc/postfix/virtual-regexp-allow

   This example uses regexp maps, but this could just as easily be a hash.

   You will need to create these two files mentioned above.  In the
   "virtual-regexp" file, you need to list the aliase account and the
   address it's translated to.  For example, if you want to forward "foo"
   to "bar" and "baz" in the "example.com" domain:

      /^foo@example.com$/   bar@example.com, baz@example.com

   In the "virtual-regexp-allow" file, you need to list the same left-hand
   with "OK" for the right hand, so that the SMTP server knows to allow
   this address:

      /^foo@example.com$/   OK

   Restart Postfix and now when you mail "foo@example.com" it should
   deliver to "bar@example.com" and "baz@example.com".

Backing up vPostMaster:

   To backup vPostMaster, you have to get the following data:

      /etc/postfix
         The location where the Postfix configuration information is
         stored.  This rarely if ever changes.

      /etc/dovecot.conf and /etc/dovecot-pgsql.conf
         Dovecot configuration and settings.  This rarely if ever changes.

      /var/spool/vpostmaster
         The directory where e-mail is stored.  This can be rather large
         and changes frequently.

      The PostgreSQL database tables.
         This is where all the mail system meta-data is stored.  I'd
         recommend dumping these into the file-system somewhere with
         "su postgres -c pg_dumpall >/path/to/backup/file".

         This data changes frequently.

      /usr/lib/vpostmaster/etc
         This includes some database access files which are required for
         some parts of the system to access the database.  This includes
         the access credentials for incoming mail processing, and the web
         interface.

      The /etc/passwd and /etc/group entry for the "vpostmaster" account.
         The uid/gid's of these accounts either need to stay the same after
         a restore, or any file ownership associated with them need to be
         changed.  In particular, /var/spool/vpostmaster must be owned by
         the vpostmaster user and writable by it, and the
         /usr/lib/vpostmaster/etc/*.conf files have to be readable by
         vpostmaster.  The "wwwdb.conf" file also has to be readable by
         Apache, which is typically done during the install by changing
         it's group to the Apache group, and changing it's mode to 0660.
